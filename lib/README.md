# Library Directory

Place your custom libraries here.

## Structure

Each library should have its own directory:

```
lib/
├── MyLibrary/
│   ├── MyLibrary.h
│   └── MyLibrary.cpp
└── AnotherLibrary/
    ├── AnotherLibrary.h
    └── AnotherLibrary.cpp
```

## Usage

Include in your code:
```cpp
#include <MyLibrary.h>
```

PlatformIO will automatically compile libraries in this directory.
